## Overview

Hello, I'm John, and I'm a Research/engineer, technical leader, and entrepreneur working at the intersection of blockchain infrastructure (Solving, Market Making, Arbitrage) and Decentralized protocols (Intents, Liquidity Management, Settlement). I have a track record of driving projects from conception to completion, identifying research gaps, and providing solutions. Finally, I love leading engineering teams and have the ability to drive collaboration across the organization and the entire ecosystem.

I use [jincubator](https://github.com/jincubator) for research and development of prototypes. [Here](https://johnwhitton.com/research/solving/intro) you'll find an overview of my work in 2025 on Solving, Arbitrage and Indexing, an opinionated architecture is [here](https://johnwhitton.com/research/solving/architecture). It uses [Tycho](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/overview), Intents using [ERC-7683](https://www.erc7683.org/spec), [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), [Compactx](https://github.com/uniswap/compactx) and [Uniswap V4 Hooks](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview).

As of July 2025 I'm currently wanting to collaborate with thought leaders in this space. Specifically I'm interested in

- Grants and Bounties: Including Deliverable based grants around solving, routing, liquidity management
- Consulting Work: I'm interested in work primarily Smart Contract work and RUST Development in the Solving and Intent based space
- Full Time Roles: I'd enjoy working with a team in this space. TBD whether that will be launching the protocol I've been working with as part of a founding team or with a more established organization building out innovative frameworks in the space. I'm happy working as an individual contributor or leading engineering teams, as have done so for a large part of my career. Historically I've worked with Early Stage Startups 10-30 team members but am comfortable with both smaller and larger teams.

Below is a quick professional summary, more detail can be found on [my resume page](https://johnwhitton.com/resume/intro)

I worked as a Senior Protocol Engineer, previously Engineering Manager at [Eco](https://eco.com) building a payment focused intent protocol on a dedicated L3 rollup. Read the docs [here](https://docs.eco.com/) and the code [here](https://github.com/eco/eco-routes).

I have researched zero knowledge proofs, cryptographic primitives and consensus protocols.

I consulted as a research engineer providing strategy, research, design and building out DeFi infrastructure including trustless bridging, web3 identity and wallets. Deployments have been on EVM compatible chains including [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) and [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/).

I prototyped the DEX [Kanga Finance](https://github.com/kangafinance) (inspired by [Sushi](https://github.com/sushiswap)) and a DeFi parachain [eave.network](https://github.com/eavenetwork) (inspired by [Acala](https://github.com/acalanetwork)). Deployments on [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/) and [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/). As founder for these projects, I was responsible for writing whitepapers, reviewing legal infrastructure, and fundraising. Although projects had investor interest and were awarded [hackathon prizes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZGrbKSaAdtzvMzVh0EVFBfUvA4SqiAeYVXGhJN7Orbs/edit#slide=id.g48989ac23a_0_0) the projects did not move forward due to a combination of team commitment, market fit and crypto market conditions.

Previously I was as an Ecosystem Architect at Harmony. Where I helped launch the Harmony Mainnet, grew the ecosystem and was also intimately involved with hiring decisions and business strategy. Prior to this I was CTO for Loyyal (BaaS company) where we built private permissioned blockchains on Ethereum and Hypersphere Fabric and I managed a team of seven engineers.

I have worked extensively with decentralized financial protocols, bringing a unique perspective by combining my extensive corporate experience with IBM, SAP, Deloitte and KPMG with the disruptive financial models being developed on blockchain.

My earlier career focused on enterprise applications, service oriented architectures and cross application business processes. Where I founded a consultancy firm which grew to $800k in revenues and ran from 2000-2009. One of my former clients, EFI ($1.6 billion market cap) brought me on as a Manager in Enterprise Systems Architecture where I remained for 6 years.

I have been passionate about software and technology since high school. I graduated from the University of Queensland with a Bachelor of Science majoring in Computer Science before travelling globally leading the design and development of many Service Oriented Architectures and Blockchain implementations.
