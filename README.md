## Building high-performance solving and market infrastructure
I build high-performance solving and market-making infrastructure and DeFi protocols (Intents, Liquidity Management, Settlement), including

- [Solver](https://www.jincubator.com/research/solving/solving): Advanced Liquidity Mapping and Route Evaluation supporting multiple strategies for solving and market making.
  - Built on Tycho with its own liquidity mapping layer, able to evaluate over 1000 routes per second
- [Solving Integration](https://www.jincubator.com/research/solving/tycho1inchNOL): UniswapX, 1inch, and CowSwap
- [Liquidity Management](https://www.jincubator.com/research/Intents/protocol): ERC-6909 Resource Management built on the compact
- [DeFi](https://www.jincubator.com/research/solving/intent-management-hook): UniswapV4 Hooks, NoLiquidity Solving, IntentSwapHook


## Overview

I'm John, and I'm a Research/engineer, technical leader, and entrepreneur working at the intersection of blockchain infrastructure (Solving, Market Making, Arbitrage) and Decentralized protocols (Intents, Liquidity Management, Settlement).

I have a track record of driving projects from conception to completion, identifying research gaps, and providing solutions. 

Ultimately, I enjoy leading engineering teams and can foster collaboration across the organization and the broader ecosystem.

I use [jincubator](https://github.com/jincubator) for research and development of prototypes.
